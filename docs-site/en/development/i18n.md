# Internationalization (i18n)

Shimeji-Live supports multiple languages to serve users worldwide. This guide will explain how to add new language translations to the application.

## Language Files

The application's UI text is stored in `.properties` files located in the `conf/` directory.

- **`language.properties`**: The default language file. If a translation for a specific language is not found, the system will read from this file. English is typically used as the default.
- **`language_en.properties`**: The English language file.
- **`language_zh.properties`**: The Chinese language file.
- **`language_xx.properties`**: Files for other languages, where `xx` is the [ISO 639-1](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) language code.

## File Format

`.properties` files are simple key-value text files.

```properties
# This is a comment
Key=Value
AnotherKey=This is a value
```

- **`Key`**: The unique identifier for the text. **Keys must be consistent across all language files.**
- **`Value`**: The translated text for the corresponding language.

### Example: `language_en.properties`
```properties
Exit=Exit
Settings=Settings
```

### Example: `language_es.properties` (Spanish)
```properties
Exit=Salir
Settings=Configuración
```

## How to Add a New Language

Let's say you want to add Spanish (`es`).

### Step 1: Create the Language File

1.  In the `conf/` directory, copy the `language_en.properties` file.
2.  Rename the copied file to `language_es.properties`.

### Step 2: Translate the Text

1.  Open the `language_es.properties` file.
2.  Line by line, translate the English text on the right side of the equals sign (`=`) into Spanish. **Do not modify the keys on the left side of the equals sign.**

   ```properties
   # From:
   Exit=Exit
   Settings=Settings

   # To:
   Exit=Salir
   Settings=Configuración
   ```

### Step 3: Update Language Selection Logic (Optional)

The current version of Shimeji-Live may automatically select the language file based on the operating system's language settings. If a UI for manual language switching is needed, the Java source code would need to be modified, which is beyond the scope of this translation guide.

Typically, the application will try to load `language_{locale}.properties` and fall back to `language.properties` if it fails.

## Naming Convention for Translation Keys

To maintain consistency, please follow these conventions:

- Use `CamelCase` or `PascalCase`.
- Key names should be descriptive, e.g., `DismissConfirmation` instead of `msg1`.
- Keys related to menu items can be prefixed with `Menu`, e.g., `MenuFile`.

## Important Notes

- **Encoding**: All `.properties` files should use `UTF-8` encoding to ensure all characters are displayed correctly.
- **Consistency**: Ensure that all language files contain the same keys. If a key is missing in a specific language file, the application will use the default value from `language.properties`, which may result in a mix of languages in the UI.
- **Testing**: After adding a new language, launch the application and check all menus, dialogs, and messages to ensure the translations are displayed correctly and are not truncated or formatted improperly.

By following these steps, you can easily contribute new language translations to Shimeji-Live, allowing more people to enjoy this fun desktop application!
